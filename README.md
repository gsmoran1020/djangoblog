# Django Blog

## Overview
A fully functional blog application that features a variety of common blogging features. This application allows people to create accounts, make posts, comment and like other users posts, update/delete their own posts, search for posts, and edit their profiles. If a user forgets their password, it even has password recovery by email.

This project was originally a tutorial project that I modified. I added search, comment, and likes functionality to the base project. This project was my initial introduction into Django and served as a great resource for learning a variety of the tools django has to offer.
